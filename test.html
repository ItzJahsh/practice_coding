        When you fire up Epic Games Store, Steam, Xbox, or any of the other<br />
        digital marketplaces for PC games, you'll be faced with many
        purchasing<br />
        options. Feel like casting spells and slaying beasts in a
        role-playing<br />
        game? The Witcher III: Wild Hunt and Xanadu Next got what you need.
        In<br />
        the mood to knuckle up against online opponents? A fighting game like<br />
        Street Fighter V: Champion Edition or Tekken 7 will do you good. In<br />
        short, the PC gaming space is deep and varied. Don't get frozen by<br />
        choice, though; use this guide to help you make a swift and wise<br />
        purchasing decision.

          Please recognize, however, that this is not a historical
          examination<br />
          of the most groundbreaking PC games. Sure, Metal Gear Solid V: The<br />
          Phantom Pain redefines stealth-based action and the Forza Horizon<br />
          series is the definitive open-world racing franchise, but they
          didn't<br />
          make it into this guide based purely on those metrics. Simply put,<br />
          this an ever-expanding collection of entertaining titles you should<br />
          buy if you own a gaming desktop or gaming laptop.<br />
